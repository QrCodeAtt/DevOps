Smart Mini Class Attendance Management System using QR Codes.
The system automatically generates a QR Code for any registered student and enables teachers to set their class attendance time. 
The system employs the concept of geofencing to mitigate indiscriminate signing of attendance from any location.

How It Works
Students and teachers are registered on the system
QR code is automatically generated for any registeerd student
Lecturer sets class time, attendance grace time and lecture close time
The system is automatically triggered to start taking attendance once the time set is reached
Students that come within the allowed time can swipe their QR codes, if they are still within the stipulated time or grace time and in the allowed location, their attendance is recorded otherwise it is assumed absent.
If a student forgets his/her student card, he can log in to the system to take attendance manually.

Limitations
We didn't factor in permissions ie if a student takes permission from the lecturer, the system won't know. This feature can be included in an advanced system.
We do no authenticate if the real owner of the QR code is the one taking the attendance. We can improve this in an advanced system.
We assumed there will always be power supply.

This project is a simple class project aimed at understanding the concept of devops
